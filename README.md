For this challenge, you’ll work with an existing Java EE application designed for a retail webshop. The current version of the webshop is a Java EE application built for Oracle Weblogic Application Server. As part of a modernization strategy you’ve decided to move this application to JBoss EAP, containerize it, and run it on a Kubernetes platform with OpenShift.

For this lab, we will use the [MTA] (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/5.2/html/introduction_to_the_migration_toolkit_for_applications/what-is-the-toolkit_getting-started-guide) IDE Plugin based on CodeReady Workspaces.
